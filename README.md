# ACOS
Yet another iteration of the ACOS Operating System, this time software-based with Python !

## Install
Simply download the latest release from the releases tab [\(at this link\)](https://github.com/megat69/ACOS/releases/latest).

You will need Python installed in order for it to work.

The supported Python versions are 3.7+, but 3.6 should work as well.<br/>
*Notice that some apps in the ACOS might require higher versions of Python, so you should have the latest version installed.*

Before launching the program for the first time, you should launch the `setup.py` script, which will install all the dependencies.

After the setup is complete, and like every time you'll want to launch the ACOS, you can run the `boot.py` script.

## Create, publish, and download apps
Everything is explained in [this repository.](https://github.com/megat69/ACOS_Apps)

## Advanced functions
The ACOS works in combination with a few files, that can enhance your experience, despite making the ACOS not officially supported.

Such file is the `registry.json` file, that works as a registry for the ACOS.<br/>
You will find inside a lot of variables that handle all the work for the ACOS.

If you modify something and you are stuck with a BSOD, try running the diagnostic/fix script `registry_cleanup_utility.py`.
